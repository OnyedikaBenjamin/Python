# Multiple assignments allow us to assign multiple variables at the same time using one line of code.

# Lets say ...

name = "Ben"
height = 5.55
age = 30
loves_coding = True

# we can write the above statement using a multiple assignment

my_name, my_height, my_age, love_coding = "Ben", 5.55, 30, True

print(my_name)
print(my_age)
print(my_height)
print(love_coding)

# Let say all the niggas below have the same age

# Spongebob = 30
# Patrick = 30
# Sandy = 30
# Benjamin = 30

# If we want to use a multiple assignment to write this, the syntax will be quite different

Spongebob = Patrick = Sandy = Benjamin = 30
